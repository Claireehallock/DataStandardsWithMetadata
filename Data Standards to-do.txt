- fix just add metadata
    - flag if field doesnt exist
- figure out alter length
- add domains to md
- quality check:
    - duplicates, check if desc is populated, check for domains in fields
- (potential): Check metadata for things like "contacts", "constriants", etc

2 separate tools for data standards and md quality
    params: Check for dupe fields and give options to delete/rename fields within metadata
            Fill in descriptions whatnot
domain range vs coded values

get rid of duplicates in the quick fix tool
Also add description adding part to quick fix
Old tools dont automatucally separate domain list values
fix range domains in rest of tools
Check domains better within quick fix

Fix Fields needs to check for incorrect Names
    MD description of fields that dont exist in the dataset
    For md with no fields, add checkbox to remove or not. Also include description
    for field with not md, also add checkbox to add or not
For auto-populate alias in separate values, explain that it is the alias

low priority:
    Flag when user is changing out of separate keys list
